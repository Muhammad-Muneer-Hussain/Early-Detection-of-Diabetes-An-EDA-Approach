Early Detection of Diabetes â€“ EDA Project
Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of diabetes by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from the Pima Indian population. The primary goal is to understand patterns in the data that can help predict diabetes risk and support healthcare interventions.

Problem Statement
Diabetes is a serious health condition that can lead to severe complications if not diagnosed early. This project aims to:

Analyze the distribution of health-related features.
Explore relationships between these features and diabetes outcomes.
Identify trends that may indicate diabetes risk.
Dataset
